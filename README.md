### Character recognition using python
## [Google docs for discussion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ccrn5BP424HiEsqlq86opxBvWaF_ki8TPLz7nwiEi70/edit)
## Note
alldescriptors.txt is a large file (~105 MB) hence I have compressed it in alldescriptor.tar.gz. Please uncompress it before using the code.
## Plan
- [x] Getting SIFT descriptors from image files
- [x] Generating bag of words 
- [x] Generating training vectors using K-means clustering
- [x] Implementing basic multiclass SVM 
- [ ] Implementing other variants of SVM for classification
- [ ] Test results
